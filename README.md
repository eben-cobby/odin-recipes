# odin-recipes

I am going to build a basic recipe website using basic HTML.
I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

By the end of this project, I would have demonstrated how to:
1.Create a repository on github and clone it onto my local machine
2.Build a basic recipe website in HTML.Build pages of food recipes and link it to the homepage.
